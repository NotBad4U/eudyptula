Major number 10 is officially assigned to the misc driver. 
Modules can register individual minor numbers with the misc driver and take care of a small device, 
needing only a single entry point.


What little said of my code before the refactoring:

- Don't be noisy.  This function can be 1 line log.  Or really, 0 lines...

- That's not a major number.

- Why call this if ret is an error?

- This check isn't needed.

- No error checking?

- This whole function is too complex, and can be made much more "simple".
{hint} and can be done in one line of code.

- wrong error.

Maybe that can help you too :p
